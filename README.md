# Hotel-reservations-analysis-with-SQL
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In this project, I worked with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. I have used SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer 15 questions about the dataset.
